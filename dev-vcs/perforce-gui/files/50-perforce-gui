# P4V comes with its own libraries and knows where to find them so it will work
# "just fine".
#
# However, without this file in /etc/revdep-rebuild, running the revdep-rebuild tool
# will likely find that p4v is always out of date and will try to rebuild it, which
# won't fix the apparent problem because this is a binary package.
